Arrays are linear datastructure , They have to be sequential , identical and have fixed size. 


when you create a new array , PC reserves an array of the given type with the given size ,

and creates a couple of data fields like 

1- header which stores the reference of the first element in the array ,

2- a variable which stores the number of bits of the array's type 

e.g like integers = 32 , and boolean = 1 bits

so that if you need to access an element in the array ,

the computer answers your query in o(1) by calculating

header + your query index * the array's data type size.

for instance , if you need to get the value in the index 4 in an array of integers and the first array's element in the position 1000 

in the PC's memory then , the computer gets you the value in the position (1000+4*32) which means 

(header+index*number of bits for integer).

-multi dimension arrays : 

Also , PC reserves a variable for number of dimensions , 

the size of each dimension the array should be identical as the computer should know the data type size 

to calculate each position you give to it. the computer will need to calculate the sum of data type before the index you give to 

it to get you the right position if the array is not identical. Also , the array should be sequential as the computer will 

need to calculate the sum of all empty places in the memory before the index you give to it 
and after the head of the array to get you the right position. the array should have fixed size as if you created an array 
with size 4 and you need to put an element in the 5-th position , it may be not empty :). 



when you create a multi dimension array for instance , int a[]=new int[3][5] PC reserve (sequentially)three arrays with size 5.

if you want to get the value in a[2][3] , then the formula is

header+2*size of the array(1d)*num of bits in integer+3*num of bits in integer.
